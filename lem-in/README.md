# ants
This project is meant to make a digital version of an ant farm. The examples folder contains example files with all data about ants, tunnels and their conections. 
The point of project is to provide most efficient paths for ants from start-room to end-room.

## Usage
For running the project with a specific example in mind from the examples folder use:

```console
go run main.go example00.txt

```

You can also add your own examples to the examples folder and run them if you wish.

## Testing
```
To run the automatic test, execute './ audit_script.sh'
```
